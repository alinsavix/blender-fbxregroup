# fbxregroup

Read the headers for what this does. Basically, it makes fbx kitbash files
with lots of individual components a bit more useful in blender (at least,
assuming you dislike waiting forever for a single huge kitbash file to
load)

Right now the performance on this sucks.

Right now the code on this sucks.

Really, just about everything here sucks. I may or may not make it better.
